## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of a maintainer
